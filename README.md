# WCU-CSC-References - Introduction
This repository is meant to be an archive of anything and everything  related to WCUPA's CSC curriculum. Each class has a folder, and there is a general "master-guide" for references located on the main page.

## How is information organized?
Each class or topic has a folder, which contains all of the information necessary to faciliate student learning. Some folders are more generally organized by programming language or concept (*such as the Java directory, which contains everything on java!*), depending on the versatility of the material.

## How do I contribute?
Anyone and everyone is free to contribute to these documents, as well as review current documents. However, keep in mind that **your contributions will be public**. Please be considerate of others, and give feedback kindly!
